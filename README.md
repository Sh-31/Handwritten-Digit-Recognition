# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits. It uses the popular MNIST dataset, which contains a large database of handwritten digits. The goal is to train a neural network to accurately classify these digits.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following steps:

### Step 1: Importing Libraries
- Importing necessary Python libraries and modules for image processing and machine learning.

### Step 2: Setting up the Database
- Loading the MNIST dataset for training and testing.

### Step 3: Normalizing Images
- Normalizing the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1.

### Step 4: Building the Model
- Creating a neural network model with three layers for digit recognition.

### Step 5: Compiling and Fitting the Model
- Compiling the model with loss and optimizer settings and training the model on the training data.

### Step 6: Evaluating and Saving Weights
- Evaluating the model's performance on the test data and saving the model weights to a file.

### Step 7: Testing
- Loading the saved model and using it to make predictions on new images.
